0,LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11By #BlackLivesMatter And #FYF911 Terrorists [VIDEO],"No comment is expected from Barack Obama Members of the #FYF911 or #FukYoFlag and #BlackLivesMatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  She posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the American flag.For entire story: Breitbart News",1

The RS-28 Sarmat missile, dubbed Satan 2 by Nato, has a top speed of 4.3 miles (7km) per second and has been designed to outfox anti-missile shield systems. The new Sarmat missile could deliver warheads of 40 megatons – 2,000 times as powerful as the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Scroll down for video Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly planning to replace the country’s older SS-18 Satan weapons with the new missiles amid a string of recent disagreements with the West.

5,About Time! Christian Group Sues Amazon and SPLC for Designation as Hate Group,"All we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the Southern Poverty Law Center!On Tuesday, D. James Kennedy Ministries (DJKM) filed a lawsuit against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the charity navigation organization GuideStar, and Amazon, for defamation, religious discrimination, and trafficking in falsehood. The SPLC listed DJKM as a  hate group,  while GuideStar also categorized it in those terms, and Amazon kept the ministry off of its charity donation program, Amazon Smile. We embarked today on a journey to right a terrible wrong,  Dr. Frank Wright, president and CEO at DJKM, said in a statement Tuesday.  Those who knowingly label Christian ministries as  hate  groups, solely for subscribing to the historic Christian faith, are either woefully uninformed or willfully deceitful. In the case of the Southern Poverty Law Center, our lawsuit alleges the latter. The SPLC has labeled DJKM an  anti-LGBT hate group  for its opposition to same-sex marriage and transgenderism.  These false and illegal characterizations have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion and on religious free speech for all people of faith,  Wright declared. After having given the SPLC an opportunity to retract, we have undertaken this legal action, seeking a trial by a jury of our peers, to preserve our own rights under the law and to defend the religious free speech rights of all Americans,  the DJKM president concluded.The lawsuit laid out charges against the SPLC, GuideStar, and Amazon.Read more: PJM",1

The post was made on the Ringling Bar s Facebook page Tuesday night and has since received hundreds of comments and shares. The post reads:  The Ringling Bar will no longer show any NFL games.

Ringling Bar Co-owner Kurt Bekemans, who grew up in the Paradise Valley, published the post and said he doesn t care if the post turns some customers away.

I d like to speak for rural America: I bet you wouldn t see any farmers or ranchers in our whole country take a knee such as these guys do, I bet you couldn t find one.

9,Latest Pipeline Leak Underscores Dangers Of Dakota Access Pipeline,"FILE – In this Sept. 15, 2005 file photo, the marker that welcomes commuters to Cushing, Okla. is seen. (AP Photo/The Oklahoman, Matt Strasen, File)
Underscoring once again the dangers of America’s unreliable fossil fuel infrastructure, a significant U.S. oil pipeline has been shut down after a leak was reported Monday morning.
Enterprise Products Partners said Monday it had shut its Seaway Crude Pipeline, a 400,000-barrel per day conduit that transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to Gulf coast refineries. The leak occurred Sunday night in an industrial area of Cushing. The company did not provide an estimate of the volume spilled, but said there was no danger to the public.
“Seaway personnel continue to make progress in cleaning up the spill, substantially all of which has been contained in a retention pond at Enbridge’s facility,” the company said in a news release (pdf), explaining that the pipeline is a “50/50 joint venture” between Enterprise and Enbridge Inc. “Vacuum trucks are being used to recover the crude oil and return it to storage tanks on-site.”
“The impacted segment of the legacy pipeline has a capacity of 50,000 barrels,” the release added, “however the actual amount of crude oil released will be significantly less and won’t be determined until recovery efforts are complete.”
The incident comes after another pipeline rupture in Pennsylvania early on Friday, where 55,000 gallons of gasoline poured into the Susquehanna River, and about one month after a major gasoline pipeline run by Colonial Pipeline Co. had to halt pumping for a couple of weeks due to a spill in Alabama .
Meanwhile, UPI reports that “[t]he release from the Seaway pipeline is the second associated with the Cushing storage hub in less than a month. Plains All American Pipeline reported problems with infrastructure from Colorado City [Texas] to Cushing earlier this month.”
Environmentalists, Indigenous people, and energy companies are in the midst of a heated debate over pipeline safety . Water protectors and their allies along the proposed route of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) have been saying for months that the project threatens their right to safe drinking water.
“Oil pipelines break, spill, and leak—it’s not a question of if, it’s a question of where and when,” 13-year-old Anna Lee Rain YellowHammer, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, wrote in a recent appeal.
“With such a high chance that this pipeline will leak,” she wrote of the Enbridge-backed DAPL , “I can only guess that the oil industry keeps pushing for it because it doesn’t care about our health and safety. The industry seems to think our lives are more expendable than others’.”
Indeed, referring to the Cushing leak, one observer tweeted on Monday: “That’s why we’re screaming #NoDAPL ! They always break!”
